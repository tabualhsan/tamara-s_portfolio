              Throughout my career I have always had a passion to help others. I began the first 6 years of my journey working in the biotech and healthcare spaces. My last job as a clinical researcher for HIV at San Francisco General Hospital took a turn when COVID became a reality and my team and I needed to shift gears and our focus became to research COVID. Over-night this affected how we interacted with patients and I realized that technology was an enabler of care and how the lack of it brought many obstacles. I wanted to contribute to helping others by building technology to fill the gaps we were having, so with no programming knowledge prior, I enrolled in as many online programming courses and got the opportunity to be a part of Hackbright Academyâ€™s Software Engineering Program. I aspire to take my experience with patients, technology, and healthcare to build a better world for the future where healthcare and technology meet.
